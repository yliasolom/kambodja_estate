            <h4>What you need to know:</h4>
            <p><strong>🏠 You can own the building</strong></p>
            <p><strong>🌳 The land is on long-term lease (50+ years)</strong></p>
            <p>This is the standard way foreigners own villas in Cambodia.</p>
            
            <h4>How it works:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>You fully own the villa (the building)</li>
                <li>The land is leased for 50 years</li>
                <li>The lease can be renewed</li>
                <li>You can sell the property anytime</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Think of it as:</strong> You rent the land long-term, but the villa itself is 100% yours.</p>
            
            <h4>Is this common?</h4>
            <p>Many foreigners successfully own villas in Cambodia using this legal structure.</p>
            <p>A lawyer will help you set up the lease correctly.</p>

            <h4>What you own vs lease:</h4>

            <p><strong>🌳 You LEASE:</strong> The land underneath (long-term)</p>
