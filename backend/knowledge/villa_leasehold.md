# Villa Ownership for Foreigners (Leasehold)

## Core Rules
- Foreigners cannot own land directly in Cambodia (Article 44 of the Constitution)
- Foreigners CAN lease land long-term (typically 50 years, renewable)
- Foreigners CAN own the building/villa structure (100% ownership)

## How Leasehold Works
1. **The Land**: You lease the land from the owner for 50 years (renewable)
2. **The Building**: You own the villa/house structure completely
3. **Registration**: The lease is officially registered with the Ministry of Land
4. **Transferability**: You can sell or transfer the lease to another person

## Legal Framework
- Long-term leases are protected under Cambodian law
- The lease must be registered to be enforceable
- Renewal is possible (usually another 50 years)
- Banks accept leasehold properties for mortgages

## Common Practice
- Hundreds of foreigners own villas this way in Cambodia
- This is the most common legal structure for foreign villa ownership
- Well-established and widely used in Phnom Penh, Siem Reap, and coastal areas

## Typical Costs
- Property purchase price
- Transfer tax: approximately 4% of property value
- Lawyer fees: $1,000-$3,000 USD
- Registration fees: $200-$500 USD
- Notary fees: varies

## What You Can Do
- Live in the property
- Rent it out
- Renovate or modify the building
- Sell the property (transfer the lease)
- Pass it on to heirs

## Important Considerations
- The lease expires after 50 years (but can be renewed)
- The land always remains owned by a Cambodian citizen
- Changes in law are possible (though rare and unlikely to be retroactive)
- Always work with a qualified property lawyer

## Next Steps
1. Consult with a Cambodian property lawyer
2. Review the lease contract carefully
3. Conduct a title search on the land
4. Ensure proper registration with authorities
5. Get legal advice specific to this property
